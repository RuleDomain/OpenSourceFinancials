## About Open Source Financials

OpenSourceFinancials is an open source Laravel based extension to OpenSourcePOS hosted at https://github.com/opensourcepos/opensourcepos

The first module to be developed will be Purchasing.  More information can be found at the Wiki by [Purchasing](https://github.com/RuleDomain/OpenSourceFinancials/wiki/Purchasing)

Modules on the TODO list include:

* Purchasing
* Accounts Payable
* Accounts Receivable.
* Tax Reporting
* General Ledger

This system will not be competing with the heavy hitters in the industry.  It is intended to "get the job done" for small companies


## Migration

There will be few new tables introduced with the migration script, but this project's MINIMUM REQUIREMENT is that OPSPOS 3.3 or later be installed first.  See the installation instructions for more detail.

## Future Technology

Originally I was going to implement GraphQL and Vue.js right from the start, but with the limited amount of time that I have it is best if I start with smaller technology bites.

So the first draft with Purchasing is going to limit the new technology to just Laravel, BootStrap and SASS.  I will continue to develop the schema for GraphQL so that I can explore it as time allows, but it will not be a priority.


## Contributing

Contributions are not being accepted at this time.  But thanks for being interested.  I will open it up for contributions once the first draft is working to my satisfaction.

I want to give a "shout out" to Brandon Share at https://github.com/BrandonShar for providing a working example of the architecture I wanted to use in this project.
He also wrote a couple of articles that provided numerous insights into the framework.  I struggled with numerous configuration issues until I found his GitHub project.
