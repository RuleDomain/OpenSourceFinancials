## About OpenSourceFinancials

OpenSourceFinancials is an open source Laravel based extension to OpenSourcePOS hosted at https://github.com/opensourcepos/opensourcepos

This software implements GraphQL using  [Laravel Lighthouse](https://lighthouse-php.com/)

It also uses [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) with [Apollo Vue](https://vue-apollo.netlify.com/) as the user interface providing a much improved user experience.

The first module to be developed will be Purchasing.  More information can be found at the Wiki by [Purchasing](https://github.com/SteveIreland/OpenSourceFinancials/wiki/Purchasing)

Modules on the TODO list include:

* Purchasing
* Accounts Payable
* Accounts Receivable.
* Tax Reporting
* General Ledger

This system will not be competing with the heavy hitters in the industry.  It is intended to "get the job done" for small companies
